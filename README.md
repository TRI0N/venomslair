This was setup so that I can easily track the changes that I make and helps me understand how the versioning works.  This site isn't updated as frequently as I like to so the commits maybe older. The only pages that are updated daily are the IRC Logs so you will see more commits from there.


Sorry for that, I am trying to do more updates when I can, please bear with me.

If you want to make a suggestion on an improvement then I believe you need to use the issues queue to make you suggestion.
