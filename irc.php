<span class="boldunder">FAQ's</span><br />
<br />
<span class="underline">How in the world do I connect to IRC?</span><br />
Download one of the clients above and then configure it to connect to irc.ospreynet.info.  The specific directions on how to configure each client will be available on that clients website.  You can also connect via our website at <a href="http://ospreynet.info">ospreynet.info</a> and click on IRC at the top of the page.<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">I have a client that I would like you to include on your list, who do I contact to do that?</span><br />
<a href="http://venomslair.freshdesk.com">Click Here</a> and submit it for me to look at.<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">I need some help, where do I go?</span><br />
If you need any assistance, please go to the Osprey Website and click on IRC and then ask someone in channel.  There maybe at times where no one is available just ask your question and wait.  If you get no answer then try back again later, DO NOT write in caps, spam the channel or pm anyone in channel (we maybe away), if you do you may end up being banned.  You can also send a request <a href="http://venomslair.freshdesk.com">here</a> and we will look at it and get back to you.<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">What do I do if I was banned?</span><br />
If you were banned and you believe that you have been banned in error, you can <a href="http://venomslair.freshdesk.com">Click Here</a>, and send a request with a reason why you think you should be unbanned and we will take a look into it.<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">What if I want to know where in the world is Carmen Sandeigo?</span><br />
Well, unfortunately I cannot help you with that one.<br />
